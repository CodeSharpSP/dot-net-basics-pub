	SOLR is used  searching purposes.. this is known for all
	
	why we need to seperate application for search?
	
	Ans : Bcoz fetch some particular record (or) data

		 This is a open source one 
	
         Indexed data will be searched using SOLR search

		yeah correct
		
		but why we need to use an external system for search ?

		@Ans: This will be given the related content for searching something in websites

	What is indexing ? Why we want indexed ?

	@Ans: we all having index finger right?
		 
		 it will point something when someone asked something am I correct? 
		 
		 Yes! consider your finger is just tool, or the UI to show the result or return the result of asked key words like
		 
		 if someone ask where is my book? you will point the place by your index finger

		 if someone asked how to go for the hotel? you will say the direction if it is near to you by indexing
		
		 like go this :point_right: way 
		 
		 Actually the hotel or the book is complete data of what you looking or expecting
		 
		 but when you ask for the detail you will say just name or other key terms

       
		actual product is our expectation like we need the physical book or we need to visit hotel to eat food
		
		so but when you ask, you will use key terms like name of the hotel, or type of the hotel (veg/non-veg) or name of the book,

		or cover photo of the book with kind of data you will ask a person to get that correct?
		
	**Q :	This is my key ryt? hotel and book is your actual data so now actually as a human where these details indexed inside you ? 
		
			or let say stored you where? Edhachu notes mari note panipanga

			you showing the direction or pointing the direction when someone asked, so where you have those details on you?

	@Ans: Your brain or memory your brain has those information 
		 so your brain having all the information about those data by color of the book, 
		 cover picture of the book, 
		 size of the book, and type of the book, and type of the hotel, name of the hotel, rating (good/bad) of the hotel
		 
		 when you any one of the above key details, it will return data
		 so this is what actually searching with key words, 
		 when you use key words, 
		 it will give you your data as result which matched for that keywords
		 
		 leave the human just understand the concept
		 
		 so if the human what to know things easier he will map the keywords on his brain with data
		 
		 we will remember formulas right?

		 if the the problem is this format, we need to apply this formula kind of mapping we will do

	**Q :	 Is anyone tell why we need external search app like SOLR
		 
		 To give a better performance ,

	**Q :	 why we need to indexing ?

		Too give better user experience we can easily find the deep data faster than search data by alphabet order

	**Q :	what is search now? you will give keywords, then will get data

		Na oru term search panra na athu related ta vara result
		
		For if someone give keyword if you search the keyword in data, say an example
		
		if you have 1000 hotels in your brain someone asking about non-veg hotel having chicken bakoda
		
	**Q :	what you will do if you dont have indexing mechanism in your brain ?
			
			you need to think about 1000 hotels one by one


	**Q :	what you will do if you dont have indexing mechanism in your brain
		
		We commonly said non-veg hotel list only need to remember things when you went there
		
		what you seen there menu card and everything ?		

			if you having indexing like 
			non veg  - hotel details
			chicken bakoda - hotel details
			veg - hotel details
			both - Hotel details
			kind of mapping
			non veg  - hotel details
			chicken bakoda - hotel details (100)
			veg - hotel details (900)
			both - Hotel details (25)
		
		**kind of mapping This type of mapping which will be used will it make your search faster ? 
		instead of thinking about 1000 hotels one by one you will go and see the mapping	
		which mapping is matching then you will return the result correct 
		so these mapping is called indexing. 
		
		indexing is just map your data with relavent keywords
		Only indexed data will be search and got the result correct

		indexing or searching is not only for websites
		it is for each systems which having collection of datas
		no matter the type of system like (Website, console, windows, mobile)

		Lucene and azure search !!!
		
		understand from core :) so now you know search, indexing, and the purpose of indexing
		am correct next why we need to use external resources/systems/software for the indexing/searching purpose

		1. Indexing, Searching, and Retrving is not easy job as we thinking
		it is painful job and more critical and highly algorithamic thing
		
		We are application engineers, doing many applications for processing (storing, calculating, verifying, reporting ) the business data
		but searching is not something like that because

	**Q :	when you go for search?? answer from @everyone
	
			To sort the data,Okay got result from 50% actually, we/anyone do search for get something more easier,
			faster, and more optimastic , with ordered when you search something in google you need result faster

			Yeah!
		
			it needs to be related what you searched
			it needs to be optimastic what you actually expected

		Bt exact result varathu la
		
		Each every time it will go to search database so that it will indexing in deployment location
		So it faster to serve

		your database is already prefilled for different job Database job is store the data
		your database is instructed for the relational data and it is more havier and it is more complex
		since it has many relations among the data 
		
		coming out of your website search ,pls come out from there	try to think widely about that concepts
		so we dont care about who using search system
		
		we are talking why and how search system !!!
		
		Databases only store the data va
		
		We will not use any relational database like (SQL, ORACLE, MYSQL ) for the Search or general search

		it will store the data with relations and constraints ( primary key, foreign key, etc )

		so search is developed as more optimastic way and it is independent with actual data storage or relational databases

   **Q : why it's independent nu solluringa ?
		
		Yeah it is independent!
		for ex: no matter which system is sending data to SOLR, lucene, or elastic search

		where your storing the data indexing is what you given for indexing and its format
		that is what it will know no matter that application is using database or simply files to store data

		indexing is what you given for indexing and its format
		Nama SOLR use panrathu nala thana indexing panrom....suppose SOLR use panathavanga data va database thana maintain pannuvanga
		Atha kukura	Kekura*
		
		Yeah, correct but here we are not talking about database right here we talking about search

		ungalukku search more faster, optimastic, simpler, and ordered ah venamna neenga search tool use panna theva illa

		Search tool na like SOLR So if you need fastest search on you application you need to use search tool
		no other options SQL will work for some extend but not the level of actual search tools

		So if you need fastest search on you application you need to use
		SQL will work for some extend but not the level of actual search

		these kind of search tool you can use/integrate any of your application or software for the good user search experience

		So search tool tha efficient na athuvea ella website,Windows application la use panala la
		Yen avanga inum db use panranga

		these kind of search tool you can use/integrate any of your application

	db is storing data in optimastic way with normalized way with relations database ethukku use pannanumnu oru naal discuss pannuvom

	Google ku use panra search ena search
	that is fastest one their own system and algorithms
	
	We cannot even imagine the indexing algorithm of google
	actually I cannot, sorry
	
	**Q : what kind of data you indexing ?
		
		say if you indexing images, you have to use diff one

	**Q : Search tool oda concept  indexing and then searching thana illana SOLR matum antha concept ta
		
			all search will work based on indexing only as I know
			
			say if you indexing images, you have to use diff one
			
			indexing one of the key and core part of the search

	**Other key concepts in search**
		- storing data
		- retriving data

		Ji indexing la irukura data already stored data va thana irukum
		
		how you storing your data, in which format, and how you talk to OS's file systems to store and retrive your indexed data
		is major part

		yeah that is what both are important one
		evlo data store pannunalum ungaloda search faster ah irukkanum
		RAM ah optimaised ah use pannanum disk drive(hard disk) ah more optimised ah use pannanum
		
		- storing data - retriving data-

		indexing is the concept of splitting (tokenizing) your data and storing

		Index config apdikura part la atha mention panita podhum la

	***Search is
		1) indexing 
		2) storing
		3) retriving

	1.	Fst one okay ji

		store panrathu nama normal ah file la write pannuvom

		Indexing mapping the data or ethuna database use pannuvom
		illaina ethavathu pendrive la store pannuvom ana Give Ex
	
	Example ::
		
		ithula data va write panrathu yaru?
		neenga kodukkura data va disk la write panrathu yaru?

		Internal edhachu iruka
		Write panrathukunu
		Some logic mari
		
		irukkalaam, we will use FileWritter for windows (.net)
		athu write panratha vida speeda ungalala write panna mudinja ??
		
		System internal la panrathu....na panrathu difference irukum la
		
		unalala oru speed ana program ezhutha mudinja correct

		neenga oru internal program ezhuthurenga athu exisitng ah vida speed ah iruntha? your writting will be faster right?
		
		athu mathiri internal reader unga disk la irunthu read panni kodukkuratha vida speed ah 
		read panra mathiri neenga oru porgam ezhuthuna
		your reading will be speed than normal one
		
		***Real program :
			fast ah execution
			Less memeory Consumption
			if you install A game  it Will take Less RAM Usage
	
	**programing is not just doing business logics
		Anga thaan programing velai ye irukku
		
		it is more about talking with environment where your software is going to run
		
		Programing is not just doing business logics
		
		Environment means :	system 	your device like PC, laptop, mobile, server, tab and so on and cloud too

	Ipo short ta Sollunga store panna data mattum tha enala retrieve panna mudium ryt
	yes Indexing la ella value irukum including my search term yes
	
	Q:	Ipo na data va retrieve pannanu Epdi panrathu
		
		okay, athukku neeng aoru prorgam ezhuthuvenga
		athukku naan search term kodutha Epdi ennoda data va na store Pani retrieve pannuva
		athu data va find panni return pannum
		Epdi ennoda data va na store Pani retrieve pannuva
		
		!!!athu neenga thaan yosikkanum...
		
		I mean who going to develop search engine
		SOLR/lucene ezuthunavanga enna logic use panrangannu enakku theriyathu
		but that is more faster than normal DB writting

		you are indexing 2000+ products less than 5misn right?
		if it is very good server then it will take very less time too
		
		then that writing is faster than DB insert write operation right?
		Store pandra data la ena format la irikum
		
		neenga electroics student thana	sollunga
		
		data ennava disk la store agum?
		
		bits, bytes, track, sector
		padichirukengala?
		
		oru write head angaium, ingaium move agum!!
	
		NTFS file system nu laam padichiruppome...!
		
		storing is nothing just writing your data into the disk
	
	means, once you send data to solr,
	it needs to store in file after processed its indexing algorithm
	
	storing (writing) and retriving (reading) is common process for all the systems; 
	because all the systems playing with datas; 
	so somehow it needs to store/write and retrive/read.
	
	For example when you sending data to one machine to another machine; 
	calling the APIs and passing data; 
	that needs to write convert your data into stream and need to write in network protocols
	
	the same way the data needs to write into your disk....
